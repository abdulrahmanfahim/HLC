HLC, a language built on the C programming language, HLC will implement the easiness of python and high level languages, to make sure it can run low level, the syntax will be the following:

NOTES:

%c allows anything to be put, floats, strings, integers.
we can now assign variables to input directly without doing scanf
the operating library (embedded library) will allow us to create a simple operating system that has a shell (needsthe shell library) and can do simple commands like the Linux kernel can do.


FIRST: HLC Basics


include stdio.h
include time.h


main (
	char name[50]
	int val = 1
	char string = "Hello"
	input("What's your name?", name)
	printf("Hello %s", name)
	printf("Time at your local area is: %c", time.hms)
	printf("the value of val is: %d", val)
	printf("the string is: %s", string)
)


SECOND: operating systems using HLC


include operating.h
include shell.h

main.operatingsystem (
	char prompt = ">" 
	shell.usingprompt[{prompt}](
		start.shell()
	)
	COMMANDS=[echo, clear, ls, rm, cd, rmdir, exit]
	for cmd in COMMANDS through operating.h (
		operatingsystem.commands.enablefromlist[COMMANDS]
		important(
			
		)
	)
)


THIRD: graphical uses in HLC


NOTES: this will run a version of xfce4 we will build together from the opensource xfce.


include operating.h
include graphicaloperating.h
include xfce >> this version of xfce has all the dependencies like the window managger, xfceterminal, and etc..

main.operatingsystem.graphical (
	using graphicaloperating.h with xfce(
		main.operatingsystem.graphical(
			using xfce (
				main.operatingsystem.graphical.run()
			)
		)
	)
)
